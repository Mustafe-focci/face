   <h1>history of somalia </h1>
   <p>Somalia (Somali: Soomaaliya; aṣ-Ṣūmāl), officially the Federal Republic of Somalia (Somali: Jamhuuriyadda Federaalka Soomaaliya, Jumhūriyyat aṣ-Ṣūmāl al-Fideraaliya) and formerly known as the Somali Democratic Republic, is a country located in the Horn of Africa. The country was an important centre for commerce with the rest of the ancient world,[1][2] and according to most scholars,[3][4] it is among the most probable locations of the fabled ancient Land of Punt.[5][6] During the Middle Ages, several powerful Somali states and port towns dominated the regional trade, the Mogadishu Sultanate and Ajuran Sultanate both centered around the port town Mogadishu, but also the port towns of Barawe and Merca.

    In the late 19th century, through a succession of treaties with these kingdoms, the Italian 
    colonial empire gained control of parts of the coast, and established the colony of 
    Italian Somaliland.[7][8] In southern parts of Somalia, the Italians fought a decades-long 
    war, dubbed the Banadir Resistance, with the Somalis around the port town of Merca. Italy 
    acquired full control of the northeastern, central and southern parts of the territory 
    after successfully waging a Campaign of the Sultanates against the ruling Majeerteen
     Sultanate and the Sultanate of Hobyo.[8] This occupation lasted until 1941 when it was
      replaced by a British military admin
      <p>In 1950, the Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian administration was established as 
        a United Nations Trusteeship, with a promise of independence after 10 years. British 
        Somaliland, nominally independent as the State of Somaliland (now Somaliland) for four days,
         merged as planned with the trust territory in 1960. Together, they formed the independent 
         Somali Republic under a civilian government, the Somali National Assembly, headed by Haji 
         Bashir Ismail Yusuf.[9] The administration lasted until 1969, when the Supreme 
         Revolutionary Council led by Mohamed Siad Barre, seized power in a bloodless coup and
          renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic. In 1991, the Somali Civil War divided 
          the entire country. Despite the establishment of the Interim, Transitional, and Federal
           governments, Somalia remains divided with Somaliland gaining de facto
         independence.</p>

         <h2>Prehistory</h2>
         <p>Somalia has been inhabited since at least the Paleolithic, when the Doian and Hargeisan 
            cultures flourished.[10] The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes 
            from cemeteries in Somalia dating back to the 4th millennium BC.[11] The stone implements 
            from the Jalelo site in the north (about halfway between Berbera and Hargeisa) were also 
            characterized in 1909 as important artefacts demonstrating the archaeological universality
             during the Paleolithic between the East and the West.[12][13]
